# AI-Driven Student Retention & Success Forecasting
**Excelerate Virtual Internship | AI Data Analyst Role**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project addresses a critical retention challenge where only **9.3%** of learners reached a successful outcome. By analyzing **8,558 records**, I developed a machine learning solution to predict student churn and built a recommendation engine to optimize engagement.

## 🚀 Key Results
* **Model Accuracy:** 95.97% (Random Forest Classifier).
* **Primary Insight:** Application Delay is the #1 predictor of churn—behavioral timing outweighs demographics.
* **Strategy:** Implemented a "24-Hour Nudge" and a Content-Based Recommendation System.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Cleaning), Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualization).
* **Tools:** PyCharm, GitHub, Microsoft PowerPoint.

## 📊 Methodology
### 1. Data Cleaning (Week 1)
Handled date standardizations and anomalies across 8.5k+ records to ensure a reliable training set.
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Week 2)
Identified the "Golden Window"—successful students typically apply on the same day they sign up.
### 3. Predictive Modeling (Week 3)
Compared Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. Selected **Random Forest** for its superior performance in detecting at-risk students.
### 4. Recommendation System (Week 4)
Developed a logic-based system to suggest opportunities based on learner demographics (Age, Country) and historical success rates.

## 📈 Feature Importance
![Feature Importance](visuals/feature_importance.png)
*Insight: Behavioral momentum (speed of application) is the critical factor in student retention.*

## 🤝 Collaboration
This project was completed in a remote, global environment. I collaborated with an international partner using Zoom and shared repositories to synchronize reports and cross-validate AI models.
